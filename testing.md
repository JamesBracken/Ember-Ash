## Difficult to solve bugs

When implementing my login modal I experienced problems with my modal. It was appearing behind the modal backdrop. In the documentation Bootstrap stipulates modals tend to act differently when placed into fixed components hence the issues.

I fixed this problem by taking the modal code out of the header and placing it at the bottom of the body. I also set a z-index for both the modal and modal backdrop as an extra defensive measure.
