# Testing

## Difficult to solve bugs

When implementing my login modal I experienced problems with my modal. It was appearing behind the modal backdrop. In the documentation Bootstrap stipulates modals tend to act differently when placed into fixed components hence the issues.

![alt text](./static/images/testing/modal_z_index.PNG)

I fixed this problem by taking the modal code out of the header and placing it at the bottom of the body. I also set a z-index for both the modal and modal backdrop as an extra defensive measure.

## Validator testing

### HTML validator

Testing tool - [W3C HTML Validation website]

I validated all pages across my website, everything was successful and **passed**! 

[Home page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2F) - Passed

[Signup page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Faccounts%2Fsignup%2F) 
- 1 error displays which is a Duplicate ID error. This can be ignored as there is no conflict here. 1 of the ID's is the signup form, the other is from the login modal which is in the base.html therefore available to every page. The ID attributes of these elements are injected in with Django and allauth and CANNOT be changed

[Booking page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Fbooking%2F) - Passed

[Main menu page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Fmenu%2F) - Passed

[Lunch page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Fmenu%2Flunch_menu%2F) - Passed

[Dinner page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Fmenu%2Fdinner_menu%2F) - Passed

[My profile page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Fmy_profile%2F) - Passed

[Logout page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Faccounts%2Flogout%2F) - Passed

403 page - Did not check, main 404 error page was checked however I left the other error pages out. Attempting to check these was taking way too much time which would take me out of the scope of this project and django security made it very hard to invoke these error pages.

404 page - Passed

405 page - Did not check, main 404 error page was checked however I left the other error pages out. Attempting to check these was taking way too much time which would take me out of the scope of this project and django security made it very hard to invoke these error pages.


500 page - Passed

![Error 500 page](./static/images/testing/html-validator-500-error-page.PNG)

### CSS validator

I ran my CSS validation using [Jigsaw W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Since I am not embedding any styles and I am using bootstrap classes for any inline styles (All bootstrap styles are standardized and tested already), there is no need to do multiple tests. The only necessary test here is directly testing the stylesheet. **Passed**

[CSS file](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fember-and-ash-58ab64713078.herokuapp.com%2Fstatic%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1) - Passed

### JSHint validator

I validated my JS filed with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

All javascript files **passed** with no issues!

[booking.js]() - Passed

- All warning were just to inform that the features are for ES6+

- The undefined bootstrap in this js file is obviously bootstrap, this is the modal which is declared on line 5

![JShint containing the booking.js code](./static/images/testing/jshint-booking.PNG)

[login.js]() - Passed

- All warning were just to inform that the features are for ES6+

- One warning states the body of a for in should be wrapped in an if statement to filter unwanted properties from the prototype. This in fact is wrapped within the *else* block of an if statement to filter what is needed and not needed.

![JShint containing the login.js code](./static/images/testing/jshint-login.PNG)

[menu.js]() - Passed

- All warning were just to inform that the features are for ES6+

## Lighthouse testing

I used [Chrome lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) to lighthouse my project. Initially I had some problems with security of cloudinary sending http instead of https and duplicate id's from the signup page. After fixing these issues I had very high scores all across the board, near perfect. Only area where I really lost points was lack of contrast ratio between the foreground content of my page and the background. I left this as is as I dont want to disrupt the styling of the page by adding extra font weight, this would change the look and feel of the page quite a lot and take attention away from where we want the users to actually be looking.

Home page  - Passed
